This program implements a GUI that allows the user to input a 
postfix expression and convert it to an infix expression.  It utilizes an
arithmetic expression tree and an in order traverse to convert the postfix
expression to an infix expression.  Additionally, the program writes the 
three address instructions for simplifying the expression to a file.
